                        With digital decentralization and accessibility comes digital ownership of
                        goods, media, and data. An innovative new approach to claiming these goods
                        was created in the form of blockchain based profiles.</p>

                        IDENTT allows an individual or organization to have total control over their
                        assets and identity. Fully integratable and extensible, IDENTT allows you to
                        log in with your on-chain profile into any supported dapp or game to quickly
                        start using your NFT2.0. Remembering keys and seed phrases are a thing of the
                        past with IDENTTâ€™s new recovery feature, allowing for multiple ways of recovering
